        This method will attempt to parse the repo, package, and target portion
        of the given label string. If the repo portion of the label is omitted,
        it will use the given repo, if provided. If the repo and the package
        portions of the label are omitted, it will use the given package, if
        provided. If the target portion is omitted, the last segment of the
        package will be used.

        For labels of the form "@//pkg:target", the repo name is considered the
        current repo, i.e. the empty string. Similarly, for labels of the form
        "//pkg:target".

        Note: This script currently does not accept labels with canonical repo
        names, i.e. labels starting with '@@' such as '@@foo//bar:baz.
